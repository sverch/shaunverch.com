So I'm not sure exactly what this will be, but this was like the conversation
I had about why programmers should act like "professionals" rather than like
line workers.  Think of how professionals work, there's mutual trust and
expectations, but for some reason we're ok with being put into "lanes".  That
requires deep knowledge, but we should all push there.

So there are some things to write about there.
