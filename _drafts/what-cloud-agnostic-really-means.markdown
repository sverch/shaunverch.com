"Hybrid Cloud", "Cloud Agnostic", "Cloud Portable".  These are buzzwords that
keep coming up in big acquisitions (like RedHat) and interviews with successful
software as a service companies (like ElasticSearch).

So what does this actually mean in practice?  It's important to really
understand the core point of these ideas, because if not you're going to create
false dichotomies and get in flame wars that get no one what they want.

# Build Everything Yourself?

Sometimes when people talk about something being portable and cloud agnostic,
they think that means building everything in house and only using the least
common denominator of all the cloud providers.

For most people this is absolutely the wrong approach.  Sure, there are rare
cases where you have a large enough technology team that building your own
platform from scratch can be a differentiator, but unless your badge says Google
on it you're not Google.  In the fast majority of cases this is not only a waste
of time, but creates a huge amount of risk and liability for your company.

So does this mean we're doomed to being dependent on cloud providers, sinking
further and further down the cycle of vendor lock in.  Well, no not really, but
we do have to keep some things in mind.

# What Can We Do?

Since we've established that building everything yourself is almost definitely a
bad idea, what are our options?

Just like with building everything yourself, I'm sure there are some companies
that just want someone else to do everything for you and don't care about lock
in (link mainframe post).  In my opinion this is pretty risky, and not a good
long term decision, so I'll focus on the third option.

Every decision you make about how you interact with your cloud provider either
takes you further down the path of portability or further down the path of
vendor lock in.  And sometimes you can get the benefits of a cloud service
that's managed by someone else without compromising portability at all.
