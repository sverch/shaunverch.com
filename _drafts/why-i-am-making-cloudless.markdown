Why I'm making Butter.
- You have to make a choice right now between something being easy, and something being a black box.
- I want to make it easy and transparent by optimizing for the experience of the user at every level.
- At each step, the question is what someone would be trying to do 80% of the time and make that easy.
- As I work on this project, I hope to write blog posts as I discover new core principles, or ideas that get straight to what people are trying to achieve rather than getting lost in the implementation.
