Welcome to my site!  Up until this post, shaunverch.com was hosted on Digital
Ocean and Linode and only returned a pdf of my resume.  It was configured using
very infrequently run Ansible scripts and didn't include any monitoring to speak
of.

But now I'm starting a new project called [Cloudless](https://getcloudless.com)
that aims to make provisioning your own infrastructure directly on virtual
machines across multiple cloud providers easy.  I built it because I wanted
there to be a viable option to avoid vendor lock-in, but I'll talk about that
more in a future post.  To get experience using it, both this site and
[https://getcloudless.com](https://getcloudless.com) are deployed using
Cloudless.

I do know I could use github pages (and I would highly recommend it, it's very
easy), but the point of this is to get experience using my own project on a real
system that I actually care about (how bad would it look if I claim to be a Site
Reliability Engineer but can't even keep my own site running?).  You can find
the source for this site [here](https://github.com/sverch/shaunverch.com/) and
the deployment scripts
[here](https://github.com/sverch/shaunverch.com/tree/master/deployment/).

I hope to post here about things that I've learned over the years that might
actually help people, or at least be interesting.  Feel free to [subscribe via
RSS](/feed.xml) if you're interested!
