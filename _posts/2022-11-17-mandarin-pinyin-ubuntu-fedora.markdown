I wanted to save these links, then I realized that I might as well post them in
case they help someone else in my situation.

I've seen guides to set this up with Gnome, but these worked for me with i3.

- For Ubuntu: [https://leimao.github.io/blog/Ubuntu-Gaming-Chinese-Input/](https://leimao.github.io/blog/Ubuntu-Gaming-Chinese-Input/)
- For Fedora: [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Intelligent_Pinyin](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Intelligent_Pinyin)

Both of them can be set up to be switch with a hotkey. Left click the icon in
the corner to set the key you want on Fedora (the default setting of
`<Super>space` didn't work for me).

Thank you to the writers of these guides!
